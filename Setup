Here, we are going to start building a simple microservice application, and deploy and
monitor, using K8s.
Start by unzipping the code-base: k8s-learnathon
Follow the readme to start setting up the application using the kind cluster created.
k8s-learnathon/README.md
The README covers:
1. Creating a cluster using kind
2. Walkthrough of the application (microservice)
